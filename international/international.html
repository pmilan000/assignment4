            <h2>London, England</h2>
            <p>"I traveled to London in 2004 for a close friend's wedding.  They actually had the ceremony in Nottingham, which of course makes everyone think of Robin Hood. (additional thoughts after filling in more of the page)</p>

            <h2>Venice, Italy</h2>
            <p>"Venice is one of the most interesting and beautiful places in Italy.  You see a canal walking down almost every street, with the gondalas going here and there.  The Piazza San Marco is sprawling and magnificent.</p>

            <h2>Orvieto, Italy</h2>
            <p>"When we went on our trip to Italy this was small town where our friends were getting married. (yes, another wedding overseas!) Orvieto has a cathedral, or Duomo as it is called, with a beautiful facade depicting the creation to the last judgement.  There are 1200 underground tunnels you can explore under the town.  Once you arrive there you can park your car and ride the funicular (which is the basically a cable train) up to the town."</p>

We visited several cities with my favorites being Agra, to see the Taj Mahal; Jaipur, where we were able to visit with Elephants (which was amazing); and last but not least Udaipur, which is where they held the wedding festivies."</p>
